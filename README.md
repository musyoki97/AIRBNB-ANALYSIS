# 🗽 NYC Airbnb Data Analysis

This data science project explores Airbnb listings in New York City using Python. The goal is to analyze pricing, availability, and other trends based on room types, locations, and other relevant features.



## 📊 Project Objectives

- Understand the distribution of listings and availability across NYC.
- Explore the relationship between price, availability, and location.
- Visualize trends in room types, neighborhoods, and customer reviews.
- Perform basic data cleaning and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).



## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn



## 📁 Dataset

The dataset, obtained from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)
includes Airbnb listings across New York City and contains information such as:
- Price
- Availability
- Room type
- Neighbourhood
- Latitude & Longitude
- Number of reviews, etc.




## 📌 Key Analyses

- **Distribution of Availability:** Analyzed how many days listings are available in a year.
- **Price vs Availability:** Examined how availability correlates with pricing.
- **Categorical Analysis:** Count plots for neighborhood groups, room types, and other categorical features.
- **Numerical Analysis:** Histograms and box plots to visualize distributions and outliers.
- **Correlation Heatmap:** Identified relationships between numerical features like price, reviews, and availability.



## 📷 Sample Visualizations

- 📌 Histograms with KDE
- 📌 Scatter plots (Price vs Availability)
- 📌 Count plots for top room types and neighborhoods
- 📌 Correlation heatmap
